# Streamlit Data Analysis/Visualization Through Python
A project that exercises python data analysis tools `(pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)`.

#### Description
This project utilizes `streamlit`, an interactive web application made for data visualization through python script. In this project, I implement different streamlit elements in which users can interact with to personalize a dataset about the average time that certain users spend on social media based on what they want to see. With that personalization, they could visually see the graphs change in real time. 

#### How to run the app: 
First, install streamlit through your device: 
```
pip install streamlit
```

Then, run this command in your terminal: 

```
streamlit run project.py
```

From there, the application should pop up through your personal browser.
